It allows students, staff, and faculty to book campus rooms for meetings and events, and manages the entire process from room scheduling to event approval\u200B. The system is composed of several independent services (for users, rooms, bookings, events, approvals) that work together to handle bookings and enforce college policies (e.g. requiring staff approval for certain events). This architecture ensures each service is focused on a specific business domain, enabling better scalability and maintainability.",
